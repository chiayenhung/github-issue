Not all of those entry points called `flatten` on their input. It seems that just about every method that is meant to take a single record, or that\nsplats its input, is meant to also take an array. `concat` is the earliest point that is common to all of the methods which add records to the association.

(optional) Put some `puts` statement in the `engine.rb` file to see when it is loaded.\n4. Migrate then run `rake test` \n### Expected behavior\n\nThe engine should be loaded only once.\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe `engine.rb` was loaded twice. Got some warnings that said  `warning: method redefined; discarding old test_engine_posts`. If I put a `puts` statement in `engine.rb`, it will be printed twice. This is a problem when having multiple other gems that is `require`d in `engine.rb`. In an application that I try to port to mountable engines, a bunch of \"method redefined\" warning appear. Additionally, some gem may not expect this behavior and could cause problems.\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 4.2.2, 4.2.7.1 and 5.0 \n\n**Ruby version**: 2.1.4 and 2.2.2\n"

This tries to fix this behaviour by making sure the units provided in the options hash is used and the `calculate_exponent` method only rounds up to the highest unit when no options are provided.\n\nAlso the feedback provided by @matthewd in the previous unclosed PR for this issue(#25742) has been addressed by moving the exponent calculating logic from the `convert` method to `calculate_exponent`.\n"

If your application uses a folder other than db/migrate for migrations, `ActiveRecord::Migration.maintain_test_schema!` in rails/test_help will trigger `rake db:test:prepare` at the start of each test run. \n\nWhen running database rake tasks this usually isn't an issue because they are dependent on the db:load_config task which will set `migrations_paths` based on an application's config. This is an issue however when calling `ActiveRecord::Migration.maintain_test_schema!` from rails/test_help which doesn't load the app's config, which then triggers db:test:prepare since `any_migrations?` will return false.\n\nI noticed this after upgrading my application to rails 4.2 and each time I ran my cucumber tests, `rake db:test:prepare` was getting triggered at the start. This application has a large db schema so it was adding about 30 seconds to the beginning of each run.  \n\nFixes #22261\n"

Hit the back button\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe submit button should be enabled.\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe submit button retains its `disabled` state due to the browser caching the state of the form.\n\nThis is a good thing in general – we want state to be retained as we want users to be able to edit their previous submission and resubmit. However with a disabled submit button the app is effectively broken from that point on until they know how to force a refresh (standard refresh doesn’t refresh form state) or can pop open web inspector and manually remove the disabled state.\n\nWhile I can see the utility of this behaviour it’s absolutely user hostile to make it a default. I note that in the PR that added this (https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21135) there wasn’t any discussion of the back button issue.\n### System configuration\n\nRails 5.0.0.1\nRuby 2.3.0\n"

If I initialize a new Company with `c = Company.new` and add the workers `c.workers << Worker.find(1)`, `c.workers << Worker.find(2)` and `c.workers << Worker.find(3)` and than save the company `c.save!`, only the `company_id` of the first worker in the has_many collection is updated.\n\nI would expect that all three records get the `company_id` field set (and hence be associated to the company).\n\nIf I remove the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` from the worker, it works just fine, but of cause no attributes of the company will be saved, when saving a worker.\n"

Instead, explicitly detect `-` as meaning stdin, then\nread from stdin explicitly, instead of performing file gymnastics. This\nshould now work on any platform uniformly.\n### Other Information\n\nPassing a script via stdin is useful when you're sshing to a server,\nand the script you want to run is stored locally. You could theoretically\npass the entire script on the command line, but in reality you'll run\ninto problems with the command being too long.\n"
